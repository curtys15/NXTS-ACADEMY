<p>
    Bronny is a thick and strong 6-3 combo guard with elite bounce. He’s not the biggest guard out there but he’s a mean and menacing dunker who gets off the floor with ease. He’s got good length 
    (although no official wingspan measurement) and certainly has all the physical tools to play in the NBA.

    Besides the great bounce Bronny is a complete player, a leader on the floor and a guy who makes his teammates better. He’s not the highest scoring guard you’ll ever see and his stats might underwhelm you some games but he’s the type of all around talent that helps you win. Don’t get fooled by the stats; Bronny is really, really good.
    
    Many recruiting services have him as a 4-star prospect but in my eyes he’s right on the verge of earning that 5th star. He’s not a top 10 player in the 2023 recruiting class but he’s safely in the top 30 and there’s an easy argument to be made that he should be top 20.

    Mikey Williams is a star on and off the court. His explosive dunking ability makes him a fan favorite and he’s a scoring machine who can get really hot and put up big numbers.

    He’s got rare above the rim ability for a player his size and age, bringing back memories of Steve Francis’s dunking ability. Williams is a combo guard who looks to score first and has an attacking style. He can shoot the outside shot, 
    has a mid range game and really excels at using his elite burst to get into the lane. He’s also a very capable passer who is willing to get his teammates involved.
    
    It’s a bit early to say but Mikey Williams is very much on the NBA draft radar for a few years down the line and is already a star in the prep hoops scene.He once scored 71 points in one single game
    hence making him to enter into the NXTS Hall of fame.

Trey parker is a 6-2 guard with elite bounce.He's not among the tallest guards but he is one of the most athletic.
his dunks and ability to layup the ball whatever the situation leads us to compare him to the 2021 Rookie of the year
Ja Morant.Trey attended Vertical Academy last season. Parker is a high flier on the court, whose jaw-dropping dunks have been viewed globally by millions. His game extends far beyond 
dunking with his elite shooting range. In the Underclassmen All-American Game, he made 10 three pointers on his way to scoring 42 points. In two games against 
Overtime Elite last season for Vertical Academy,
 Parker averaged 19 PPG and scored a game high 24 points in the second game.

  Zion williamson is a 6-10 power foward.Built like a bull on steroids, Williamson has great strength and supreme power, to go along with guard-like agility and insane leaping ability. He shows 
  amazing body control in the air as he explodes to the rim and on his drives into the lane, avoiding offensive fouls while going 100 MPH.

  He’s able to get from half court to the rim in a heartbeat and once he gets going downhill he’s nearly impossible to stop. His explosive first step forces the defense to bring 
  multiple defenders and he’s a more than capable passer and decision maker with the ball.
  
  He’s also an effective player in the lane, with excellent rebounding instincts. He can overpower opponents using his wide base and brute strength and 
  he has the quickness and agility to rebound out of his area. 
  He’s especially deadly on the offensive glass and he relishes the chance to hammer home a put-back dunk.
